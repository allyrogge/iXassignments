                <!-- Post Content -->
              <p>Today, I entered my final year of teen-hood while 30,000 feet in the air somewhere over the North Atlantic Ocean.  Always one for a good dramatic flair, the idea of spending my 19th birthday on a series of planes carrying me from Cincinnati to Cape Town struck me for months prior to my journey as highly symbolic. The event itself did not disappoint. </p>

<p>As I used the spotty “gogo” wifi on my laptop to finish my pre-course work, I sat front row to the most magnificent sunrise my 18 years has offered to date. The blazing orange sun emerged agonizingly slowly above salmon and ochre-hued streaks painting the horizon, overtaking the low hanging clouds just as our hundred ton aircraft overtook the International Date Line. If anyone besides me on the flight remained awake during this celestial ceremony, they certainly did not make their presence known. Alone in the clouds, my 30 hour birthday thus commenced in just as dramatic a fashion as I envisioned when booking my air tickets in February. </p> 

<p>Beneath the exhilaration of my journey dwelled a tinge of melancholy: I longed for my traditional family celebrations as much as I longed for the cabin lights to stay dim so I could watch the sunrise in noiseless 3D. As most twins can attest, the birthday denotes something of a holy day for those of us lucky enough to have a womb-mate. After all, Megan and I have spent every birthday together since that very first one, when I made my grand entrance into the world eight minutes ahead of her. Fortunately, the beautiful World Wide Web allowed me to receive Happy Birthday messages from Megan and my mom, a palliative yet insufficient replacement for a birthday spent celebrating my best friend. In lieu of gifts (besides the monumental gift of travel), my mom sandwiched a birthday letter between my laptop and Nelson Mandela book in my backpack. The older I get, the more I appreciate the cards stuffed by my mom into the nooks of my backpack and/or luggage during my adventures. As I can personally attest after almost two decades of this tradition, nothing compares to the contentment felt upon discovering a well-placed, hand-written letter in one’s belongings when thousands of miles from home.</p>

<p>As usual, my mom’s letter blended sagacious advice (“never ever go anywhere alone”) with sentimentality (recalling the time we courageously and humorously rode segways in sheets of rain for several hours on a tour of DC this summer). During my youth, I took these notes for granted: I thought everyone received beautiful motivational cards before a tough week at school, or practiced the ritual of giving letters instead of gifts to sisters on Christmas. Now, however, I realize their rarity and thus, their value, far more acutely. Attached to the back of the birthday letter was a print out of a short article called “People Who Make a Difference.”</p>

<p>The article opens by asking the reader to try to recall the ten wealthiest men in the world.  Can you? How about naming eight people who have won the Nobel Peace Prize? What about the ten most decorated Olympians in US history? Unless you’ve studied these lists, you may have had as much difficulty as I did in trying to think of three of each type of person—let alone ten. 
Another quiz follows the first: can you name ten people who have taught you something worthwhile? How about five friends who have helped you through a difficult time? I, for one, breezed through the second set of questions.  </p>

<p>Time to rewind quickly. The day before I left, I discussed with my mom over dinner one of my biggest fears: not accomplishing something massively important, not being able to help thousands and thousands of people I will never meet with some invention, process, or policy. And I think that’s actually a common fear. Climates such as college (UVA, at least, I know) or even high school drive us to believe that in order to be significant, we must constantly break new ground. According to this unspoken doctrine, we must form new clubs, get our name on research papers, or possess seats of power in order to keep up with our peers and create an impact. While these activities absolutely advance medicine, business, and policy, all too often the frenetic pursuit of unparalleled achievement overshadows the immeasurable good accomplished by less quantifiable actions. Surrounding yourself with people who support and encourage you, raising children to be sympathetic and unprejudiced, and taking time to help a friend: the impact of these actions cannot be documented. The change they affect in the world, however, does not fade at the velocity of trophies, accolades, and dollar bills. Applause dies. Achievements are forgotten. Medals tarnish. The person you take the time to mentor, however, will go on to change the life of hundreds of people. The person you listen to during their dark spell will go on to help someone else when they need it.</p>

<p>As I look forward to spending my 19th summer surrounded by incredibly accomplished college students, I vow to remember this advice. The people who make the biggest difference do not look up to the sky, fearful of their ability to impact anything because of their insignificance in the scale of the world. Neither do these people look down at others, feeling compelled to do something because of the glory and fame involved. During my 19th year, I’m instead going to look around me and soak in the present: to help those immediately in my sight, because those that make a big difference are those with concern, not with certain credentials.</p>
